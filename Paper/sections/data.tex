We have recorded 8 different activities (Table \ref{table-activities}). For each activity we did recordings on two different poistions on the body: the arm (armband), and wrist (wristband). For each setting, 5 recordings were done to generate a total of 80 recordings. Since we currently do not have any professional trainers or athletes to obtain good data from, we recorded data using the partner who we felt was the most proficient at each activity.

Recordings collect a time series of various features from  “iPhone 6” sensors (Table \ref{table-features}).We used a smart phone to stream the data from the accelerometer through Wi-Fi to a computer where it was logged in a .csv file. We converted these .csv files to .mat files so we could analyze them in MATLAB.
