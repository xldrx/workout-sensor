We have recorded 8 different activities (Table \ref{table-activities}). For each activity we did recordings on two different positions on the body: the arm (armband), and wrist (wristband). We used our right hand and right arm since we collected data from users that are right-handed. For each setting, 5 recordings were done to generate a total of 80 recordings. Since we currently do not have any professional trainers or athletes to obtain good data from, we recorded data using the partner who we felt was the most proficient at each activity.

Recordings collect a time series of various features from  “iPhone 6” sensors (Table \ref{table-features})) at a rate of 100 frames per second.We used a smart phone to stream the data from the accelerometer through Wi-Fi to a computer where it was logged in a .csv file. We converted these .csv files to .mat files so we could analyze them in MATLAB.
